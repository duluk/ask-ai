# TODO

## Structure Idea
1. Should I create multiple individual commands that do something specific,
   like ai-query and ai-review and ai-compare and ai-cmd (etc) so that the
   commands can be piped together in traditional *NIX fashion? Versus one
   command that does everything?

2. TUI version:
- history and emacs-style editing of query
- colors in text output
